      "The U.S. President Donald Trump, during his press appearance at a cabinet meeting mocked India’s aid to Afghanistan i.e., Prime Minister Modi’s statement that India funded the construction of a library in Afghanistan. Here is a fact check of his claim.  The U.S. President Donald Trump, during his press appearance at a cabinet meeting mocked India’s aid to Afghanistan i.e., Prime Minister Modi’s statement that India funded construction of a library in Afghanistan. Trump said Modi was ‘constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan’. He went onto say, ‘You know what that is? That’s like five hours of what we spend.’ Trump also said that he doesn’t know who is using the library in Afghanistan.India’s aid to Afghanistan since 2001 has been more than $2 billion It is not quite clear as to what Trump referred to when he spoke about the library India funded in Afghanistan. But, India has been one of the largest aid donors to Afghanistan since the war broke out in 2001. As per the website of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, India has an extensive developmental assistance programme in Afghanistan, which now stands at around $2 billion. This makes India one of the leading donor nations to Afghanistan and by far the largest donor in the region. Even as per the statement of an official of the U.S. Department of State to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations committee, India has allocated more than $3 billion in assistance to Afghanistan since 2001 and has also signed a development partnership agreement.Number of programs have been taken up with India’s aid money. Some of them are listed below.Important Projects: India has funded the new Afghan Parliament building which was built at a cost of Rs. 969 crores ( ~$150 million). India has also committed assistance for construction of Executive Block for the new Afghan Parliament building. In addition, India has funded the Afghan-India Friendship Dam (Salma Dam), Doshi & Charikar substations, establishment of Afghan National Agriculture Science & Technology University, Kandahar, commitment to supply 1.1 million MT of wheat to Afghanistan. India has also committed to contribute $1 million annually over next five years to Afghan Red Crescent Society for treatment of Afghan children with Congenital Heart Disease, grant-in-aid of $1 million to Habibia High School over next 10 years. India has also committed to contribute substantially in improving transportation system in Kabul and has decided to donate 1000 buses to Afghanistan along with upgradation related infrastructure.Infrastructure Projects: Some of the infrastructure projects include construction of a 218 km road from Zaranj to Delaram for facilitating movement of goods and services to the Iranian border, construction of 220kV DC transmission line from Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul and a 220/110/20 kV sub-station at Chimtala, upgrading of telephone exchanges in 11 provinces, expansion of national TV network by providing an uplink from Kabul and downlinks in all 34 provincial capitals for greater integration of the country.Small Development Projects (SDP): India is also implementing the SDP scheme in the fields of agriculture, rural development, education, health, vocational training, etc. The Small Development Projects are implemented in three phases. In the first 2 phases, the total commitment is of $20 million for 132 projects. The 3rd phase of the SDP scheme was signed in November 2012 with an additional outlay of $100 million.Skill Development: In the area of skill development, India offers training to Afghan nationals in diverse fields through 500 ITEC slots and 25 slots under TCS Colombo plan. Specialised ITEC courses are held for Afghan Government Officials on specific demand, 614 ICAR scholarships are given under India-Afghanistan Fellowship programme commenced in 2012-13 lasting up to 2020-21. India also grants ICCR scholarships to 1000 Afghans every year to pursue under graduate courses in various Indian universities in major cities across India.The other list of projects & India’s assistance to Afghanistan are listed in various Parliament answers here, here, here, here and here.What about the Library? From the information available in the public domain, it seems there no specific library project in Afghanistan. But many of the projects India funded in Afghanistan have a library component. Following are some of them.India funded the reconstruction of the famous Habibia School at a cost of $5.1 million. This included a library in the schoolIndia funded $2.7 million for the repair and renovation of 3 buildings of Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH). In addition, India also funded a medical library at a cost of $0.25 millionThe Afghan parliament building funded by India includes a huge library & auditorium.India also signed a MoU with Afghanistan on culture which includes development of archaeological institutions, museums, libraries and archivesIndia also signed a MoU with Afghanistan in the field of Human Resource Development under which India provides access and share the technology of National Digital Library of India (NDLI)India also funded a library and 8 Class rooms at Sar-E-PolWhile a specific library is not built, many of the projects India funded have a library component and hence India indirectly funded construction of libraries.What about U.S. spending in Afghanistan? While there are no accurate estimates on how much the U.S. spent on Afghanistan, multiple reports provide us a fair idea.  Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), created by the U.S. Congress estimates that $126.30 billion has been appropriated for Afghanistan relief and reconstruction since 2002. SIGAR’s latest quarterly report puts this figure at $132.07 billion as of September 2018.On the other hand, the U.S. State Department website mentions that approximately $29 billion has been allocated in civilian assistance for Afghanistan since 2001. This estimate does not include the military expenditure. CNN estimates the financial cost in Afghanistan at $841 billion including the military expenditure since 2001. Another report mentions that the Pentagon estimates the spending to be $45 billion each year.How true is Trump’s claim? Trump’s claim is way off the mark even after considering the varied estimates by different agencies about the U.S. spending in Afghanistan. With the least estimates, the 5 hour spending of U.S. comes to $1.03 million while with the highest estimates, it comes to $30 million for 5 hours. Both these estimates are less than what India has spent on various library projects in Afghanistan.EstimateU.S. Department of State (only Civilian Assistance)SIGARCNNTotal for 16 years in $ Billion29.00132.07841.00For One year in $ Billion1.818.2552.56For One day  in $ Million4.9722.61144.01For 5 hours in $ Million1.034.7130.00 Claim: India’s spending on building a Library in Afghanistan is like 5 hours of what U.S. spends in Afghanistan.Fact: Trump’s claim is way off the mark even after considering the varied estimates by different agencies about the U.S. spending in Afghanistan.

      "The Congress party has made a series of claims about the budget allocation & expenditure on education and health during the UPA. The following article is a fact check of the claims made on the Congress website.  The Congress party has made a series of claims about the budget allocation & expenditure on education and health during the UPA. The following article is a fact check of the claims made on the Congress website.What is the expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP? One of the claims made by the Congress is that, ‘the Indian National Congress has always placed a high premium on education. Both UPA I and UPA II continued with this intense and pro-active approach to achieve maximum coverage. The share of GDP allocated for education (primary, secondary and tertiary) saw an increase from 3.29 per cent in 2004-2005 to 3.83 per cent in 2012-13.’ This claim is represented by the following infographic on its website.The National Policy on Education, 1986 as modified in 1992 has laid down that the investment on education be gradually increased to reach a level of 6% of the National Income as early as possible. The draft National Education Policy of 2016 also reiterates the same.The share of GDP allocated for education over the years is in the following graph. The data has been compiled from responses to Lok Sabha  & Rajya Sabha questions 2431, 1229, 4208, 1566, 40, 3563, 2314.It can be seen from the graph that the public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP for the year 2004-05 was 3.39% and for the year 2012-13 was 4.29%. The percentage of GDP being allocated for education has risen continuously over the years. But the allocation is significantly below the 6% mark as outlined in the NPE.Claim: The share of GDP allocated for education (primary, secondary and tertiary) saw an increase from 3.29 per cent in 2004-2005 to 3.83 per cent in 2012-13.Fact: The public expenditure on education including technical education as percentage of GDP for the year 2004-05 was 3.39% and for the year 2012-13 was 4.29%. Hence, the claim is TRUE. But the expenditure is way less than what is mandated by the NPE 1986 & 1992.What is the share of public expenditure on Health as a percentage of GDP? The second claim made by the Congress is that, ‘It has been the Indian National Congress’s concerted effort to provide easy access to quality and affordable health care through government funded programmes. The share of public health expenditure to GDP of the country was doubled from a mere 0.13% in 2000-01 to 0.26% in 2010-11 respectively. For the year 2012-13, the Budget for healthcare was earmarked at a whopping Rs. 24,261 crore.’  The claim is represented on the website by the following infographic.‘The National Health Policy of 1983 and the National Health Policy of 2002 have served well in guiding the approach for the health sector in the Five-Year Plans. Now 14 years after the last health policy, the context has changed in four major ways,’ states the National Health Policy of 2017.While the National Health Policy of 2002 proposed to increase the health sector expenditure from 5.2% of GDP with 0.9% Government contribution to 6% of GDP with 2% from government by 2010, the National Health Policy (2017) proposes raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of GDP in a time bound manner by 2025.Based on the data collected from World Health Organisation and Lok Sabha question number 192, the public health expenditure to GDP of the country was 0.90% in 2000-01. This number has increased to 1.35% in 2010-11. The economic survey of 2016-17 also lists down the public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP.The expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the year 2012-13 is Rs. 23265 crores. The following graph shows the public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The graph shows a rise and fall of the health expenditure of the government as a percentage of GDP with a sharp increase in the year 2016-17 during the current government. Claim: The share of public health expenditure to GDP of the country was doubled from a mere 0.13% in 2000-01 to 0.26% in 2010-11 respectively. For the year 2012-13, the Budget for healthcare was earmarked at a whopping Rs. 24,261 crore.Fact: The public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP of the country was 0.9% in 2000-01. This number has increased to 1.35% in 2010-11. The expenditure of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the year 2012-13 is Rs. 23265 crores. Hence, the claim is FALSE.

      "A section on the Congress’s website talks about achievements during the UPA. One such claim relates to substantial increase in MSP during the UPA. Here is a fact check.  One of the claims made by the Indian National Congress on its website is regarding substantial increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Wheat & Paddy during the UPA. Here is a fact check of this claim.What is MSP? The Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) since 1985, earlier named as Agricultural Prices Commission) came into existence in January 1965. The 2017-18 annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare states that, ‘CACP was set up with a view to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure,  and is mandated to advise on the price policy (MSP) of 23 crops. These include seven cereal crops (paddy, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and barley), five pulse crops (gram, tur, moong, urad and lentil), seven oilseeds (groundnut, sunflower seed, soybean, rapeseed-mustard, safflower, nigerseed and sesamum), copra (dried coconut), cotton, raw jute and sugarcane.’In order to understand the MSP better, it is important to know the determinants of it. The same annual report also states that, ‘Cost of production (CoP) is one of the important factors in the determination of MSP of mandated crops. Besides cost, the Commission considers other important factors such as demand and supply, price trends in the domestic and international markets, intercrop price parity and terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, the likely impact of MSPs on consumers, in addition to ensuring rational utilization of land, water and other production resources.’ Thus, pricing policy i.e. the exercise of MSP is not based on cost only though cost is an important determinant of MSP. To understand more about what MSP is and its constituents, watch Factly’s explainer video on MSP.Has MSP increased substantially? Another claim made on the Indian National Congress’ website is, ‘The Congress-led UPA believes that the nation can’t progress unless the farmer gets a fair price for his produce. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Wheat has been more than doubled, from Rs 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs 1,285 in 2011-12. Similarly, the MSP for Paddy has been increased from Rs 560 in 2003-04 to Rs 1250 per quintal in 2011-12.’The Directorate of Economics and Statistics  & Reserve Bank of India’s handbook of statistics have data related to the MSP of various crops over the years. The Open Government Data (OGD) platform of the government also has the MSP for the years between 2003 and 2012.It can be seen from the data that the MSP for wheat did increase from Rs. 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs.1285 per quintal in 2011-12. By the end of UPA’s second term in 2013-14, the MSP for wheat was Rs. 1400 per quintal. During the current government, the MSP for wheat increased from Rs.1450 per quintal in 2014-15 to Rs. 1840 per quintal in 2018-19.In the case of paddy, MSP in 2003-04 was Rs. 550 and it increased to Rs. 1080 in 2011-12 where as the numbers in the claim correspond to 2004-05 & 2012-13. The MSP for Paddy increased to Rs. 1310 per quintal by the end of UPA’s term. In the of the current government, the MSP for paddy increased from Rs. 1360 per quintal in 2014-15 to Rs. 1750 per quintal in 2018-19. It has to be noted that these prices correspond to Paddy (Common) and not grade ‘A’ paddy.If the percentage increase in MSP during various governments is considered, MSP for both paddy (common) & wheat increased by more than 60% during UPA’s first term. During UPA’s second term, the MSP for paddy increased by only 25% and by 27% in the case of wheat. The current NDA government increased the MSP for paddy by close to 29% and by 27% in the case of wheat.Claim: The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Wheat has been more than doubled, from Rs 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs 1,285 in 2011-12. Similarly, the MSP for Paddy has been increased from Rs 560 in 2003-04 to Rs 1250 per quintal in 2011-12.Fact: While these numbers are TRUE, it has to be noted that MSP increased by the greatest percentage during UPA 1. The current NDA government did better than UPA 2 in the case of MSP for paddy while it increased the MSP of wheat by more or less the same percent as UPA 2.Featured Image: Rice Paddy Field by Mikko Koponen[Creative Commons 2.0]This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

      "A section on the Congress party website talks about expenditure on various sectors during the UPA. Among other things, this section also talks about expenditure on Defence sector. Here is a Fact Check of the same.  One of the claims made by the Indian National Congress on its website is regarding the expenditure on national security and defense. The website notes that, ‘The Congress-led UPA has always considered the safety and security of each and every citizen of the country with paramount importance. The ten years of UPA rule saw a considerable increase in expenditure on national security and defence, with an increase from 77,000 crore in 2004-05 to 1,93,407 crore in 2012-13.’ Was there a substantial increase in Defence expenditure during the UPA? The then finance minister while presenting the 2012-13 budget stated that, ‘In the Budget for 2012-13, a provision of 1,93,407 crore has been made for Defence Services which include 79,579 crore for capital expenditure.’While presenting the budget of 2004-05, the then finance minister stated that, ‘Having high regard to the trend of defence capital expenditure in recent years, it has become necessary to make a higher allocation this year. Accordingly, I propose to increase the allocation for defence to Rs. 77,000 crore (as against Rs. 65,300 crores in BE 2003-04)’It has to be noted that these numbers are only allocations made and hence the actual expenditure could have been more or less than the allocated amount. We compiled the budget expenditure on the defence sector from 1998-99 (since NDA’s first term). The revised estimate was available from 1998-99 to 2007-08 while the actual expenditure was available from 2008-09 to 2016-17.The figures show that there has been a continuous increase in the allocation & expenditure on defence with every budget barring 2002-03. This is inline with increasing budget size every year. The allocation for the last few years do not include OROP expenditure. It also has to be noted that the figures mentioned on the Congress website are only allocations and not actual expenditure. For instance, the actual expenditure in 2012-13 was Rs 1,81,776 crores and not Rs 1,93,407 crores.In terms of the increase in allocation for this sector, it has been up and down over the years. The allocation increased by over 20% compared to the previous year only on three (3) occasions in the last 19 years. In the last nine years (both during the UPA 2 & the current government), the increase is less than 12%.Claim: The ten years of UPA rule saw a considerable increase in expenditure on national security and defence, with an increase from 77,000 crore in 2004-05 to 1,93,407 crore in 2012-13.Fact: What is mentioned by the Congress on its website is only allocation and not actual expenditure. The actual expenditure in 2012-13 is less than the allocation. It also has to be noted that the allocation for the defence sector has been increasing every year. Hence, the claim is only PARTLY TRUE.Featured Image: Defence sector expenditureThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

      "The Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that the previous UPA government constructed only 25 lakh houses during their last 4 years. We find that this claim is FALSE. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a gathering to mark the Grihapravesh (housewarming) of Prime Minister Awas Yojana- Grameen (PMAY-G) beneficiaries in Maharashtra, claimed that the UPA constructed only 25 lakh houses during their last four (4) years while the current government constructed 1.25 crore houses in the last four (4) years, one crore more houses. Here is a fact check of this claim.पिछली सरकार ने अपने आखिरी चार वर्षों में सिर्फ 25 लाख घर बनाए थे, जबकी बीते चार वर्षों में भाजपा के नेतृत्व वाली केंद्र सरकार ने एक करोड़ 25 लाख घर बनाए हैं। सोचिए, एक करोड़ ज्यादा मकान: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 19, 2018What are the different housing schemes of the government? As per the information available on the government’s housing website, public housing program in India started with the rehabilitation of refugees immediately after independence and since then, it has been a major focus area of the Government as an instrument of poverty alleviation. Rural housing program, as an independent program , started with Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) in 1996.  Although IAY addressed the housing needs in the rural areas, certain gaps were identified during the concurrent evaluations and the performance Audit by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in 2014. To address these gaps in the rural housing program, the IAY has been re-structured into Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana –Gramin (PMAY-G) in April 2016. The urban equivalent of the scheme was earlier known as the Rajiv Awas Yojana which has now been restructured into the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana –Urban.How many houses have been constructed over the years? Multiple government data sources have been looked at to arrive at the number of houses constructed over the years in the rural housing scheme. Information provided by the government in the Rajya Sabha in 2016, in the Lok Sabha in 2018, CAG report of the year 2014, annual reports of the Ministry of Rural development have all been combined to arrive at these figures.  As per these figures, the UPA government constructed a total of 89.65 lakh houses as part of the IAY in their last four years between 2010-11 & 2013-14. The current government on the other hand constructed a total of 111.44 lakh houses in their first four years between 2014-15 & 2017-18.As far as UPA’s last four years in concerned, the Prime Minister was way off the mark. The UPA constructed 89.65 lakh houses,  almost 3.5 times the number of houses claimed by the PM. As far as the current government is concerned and if the houses constructed in the last six months is also taken into account, the figure might be closer to the 1.25 crore houses as mentioned by the PM. It has to be noted that this is only the count of rural houses for both governments. If the urban housing numbers are also included, then the numbers for both the governments could be higher.Claim: The previous UPA government constructed only 25 lakh houses in their last 4 years where as the current government in the last 4 years constructed 1.25 crore houses, a difference of 1 crore houses.Fact: The UPA in its last 4 years constructed 89.65 lakh houses and not 25 lakh houses. Hence the claim is FALSE.How did various governments fare? In general, the number of houses constructed has seen an increasing trend over the years. The NDA-1 government under Vajpayee on average constructed around 11.68 lakh houses per year during their 6 year tenure. The average under UPA-1 was 17.39 lakh houses per year where as it was 24.7 lakh houses per year under UPA-2. Under the current government, the average per year is more than UPA 2, at 27.86 lakh per year.This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

      "The Congress party’s official twitter handle made a claim recently that compared the average annual average export growth rate between 2009-14 and 2014-18. Here is a Fact Check  The Indian National Congress Twitter page has been sharing many infographics and claims about the state of India under the NDA government. They also include comparisons of performance under NDA and UPA II governments. One of the infographics shared by the official party handle on June 30, 2018 compares the growth of exports under Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi, and claims that under the former, the average export growth was in double digits (12.3%) and under the latter it was negative (-0.4%).Why Is Export Growth Important? Exports and imports determine the Balance of Trade (BoT) of a nation. The BoT is calculated by the total value of Exports minus the total value of Imports. Because imports must be paid in foreign currency, exports play an important role in financing the imports. If imports exceed exports, the reserve of foreign currency gets depleted. Balance of Trade is important for stability of the domestic currency and also affects the exchange rate of the domestic currency. Apart from BoT, export growth is also good for boosting the country’s GDP.Growth of economy was one of the main planks of the Modi campaign in 2014.

      "Many BJP leaders including the petroleum minister were quoted as saying that the current government repaid more than  Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth oil bonds which were issued during the previous UPA government. What is the truth? Many BJP leaders including the petroleum minister were quoted as saying that the current government repaid more than  Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth oil bonds which were issued during the previous UPA government. The BJP’s official twitter handle put out an infographic which claimed that the current government repaid pending oil bonds worth Rs 1.3 crore with an interest of Rs 40,000 crore.What the economist PM Manmohan Singh said & did on petroleum prices? He said that money does not grow on trees & left unpaid bills of oil bonds worth Rs. 1.3 lakh crore. Modi govt paid off the pending bills with interest because ‘we should not burden our children’. #NationFirst pic.twitter.com/Z8zTV1kG1i— BJP (@BJP4India) September 10, 2018So how much did the current government pay for the oil bonds issued during the UPA? Is this is the only government that has paid interest on oil bonds? Were oil Bonds issued only during the UPA? Here is a Fact Check.What are oil bonds & who all issued these bonds? Oil Bonds were issued by the governments during the days when the prices of petrol/diesel were regulated. Instead of paying the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for the subsidies extended on petrol/diesel & other oil products, the governments used to issue oil bonds as compensation to these companies which are like government securities. These securities are usually long dated securities of 10-20 years. For instance, look at this notification of the Oil Bonds issued during the  UPA. Oil Bonds were issued by all the previous governments till 2010 when the petrol price was deregulated. Even the previous NDA government under Vajpayee issued oil bonds. In his budget speech of the 2002-03 budget, the then Finance Minister, Yashwant Sinha mentioned that the government will issue oil bonds.What is the worth of Oil Bonds pending? The budget documents available in the public domain reveal the information of pending oil bonds and the amount of interest to be paid on these oil bonds. As per annexure 6E of the receipt budget 2014-15, titled ‘Special Securities Issued To Oil Marketing Companies In Lieu Of Cash Subsidy’, the total value of pending oil bonds by the end of 2013-14 was Rs 1,34,423 crore. This is when the NDA government took over. As per this document, the pending liabilities related to Oil Bonds were Rs 1,34,423 crore. The only set of bonds due for maturity during 2014-19 period (the Modi government’s term) were the two sets of bonds which matured in 2015,  totaling Rs 3500 crore. (Note: This was first highlighted by Boom Live) We cross checked this with the annexure 2E of the receipt budget of 2018-19 which showed the same set of pending liabilities. In other words, the pending liabilities when the Modi government took over were Rs 1,34,423 crore and by 2018-19, the liabilities stand at Rs 1,30,923 crore. In effect, the modi government repaid only Rs 3,500 crore worth of oil bonds which matured in the year 2015. Update: The Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) under the Ministry of Petroleum has also confirmed that the current government has only repaid oil bonds worth Rs 3,500 crore.Claim: Modi government paid off the pending bills of the Oil Bonds.Fact: The Modi government paid only Rs 3,500 crore worth oil bonds which matured in 2015 and Oil Bonds worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore are still pending. Hence this claim is FALSE.What about interest on Oil Bonds? The interest payments of Government of India are captured in a document titled ‘Interest Payments’ in the demand for grants of the Ministry of Finance under the expenditure budget. All the interest payments made by the government are given in this document including the interest on special bonds to oil companies. The data of the last 20 years suggests that various government (both UPA & NDA) have been paying interest on oil bonds. The interest liability increased substantially during the UPA-1 because of the issue of multiple oil bonds. The UPA-2 paid a total of Rs 53,163 crore in interest for oil bonds in the 5-year of period between 2009-10 and 2013-14. On the other hand, the current NDA government paid a total of Rs 40,225 crore in the 4 year period between 2014-15 and 2017-18. They have also budgeted an interest payment of Rs 9989.96 crore in 2018-19.   The interest payments for the last 4 years also clearly indicate that there was no change in the outstanding amount, hence no repayments in the last four years except in 2015. Though it is true that the Modi government paid an interest of over Rs 40,000 crore in the last 4 years, the UPA-2 had also paid similar if not a greater amount of interest during their term.Claim: Modi government paid interest of Rs 40,000 crore on oil bonds.Fact: The Modi government paid Rs 40,225 crore on interest for oil bonds. Hence this claim is TRUE. But it has to be noted that even the previous UPA government paid such interest and in fact a greater amount than the current government. How do these payments match up with the increased excise duty on Petrol & Diesel? The total amount of excise duty collected by the Government of India between 2014-15 & 2017-18 is Rs 7,49,485 crore. During the same period, the government made a total payment of Rs 43,725 crore towards repayment & interest on oil bonds. The payment on oil bonds is less than 6% of the total excise duty collected on petrol/diesel. Hence to say that this was the reason for increase in taxes does not seem justified.This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

      "A press release issued in the name of former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh on 07th May 2018 mentioned about the MSP growth rates during the UPA II and the current NDA government. We fact check the claim. On May 7th 2018, former prime minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh issued a press statement about development in India, speaking in the context of the Karnataka elections. In this statement, he contrasted the nation’s growth and performance in certain areas during the current NDA rule and that of the previous UPA government. One of the claims that he made was regarding the growth rate of MSP under the two governments. He said:“Under the UPA II, the average annual MSP growth rate was 19.3%, under the NDA government; this has fallen to 3.6%”We have calculated the Minimum Support Price (MSP) growth for these respective periods and we find that there was a significant difference in the growth of MSP during the two governments, but not of the magnitude that Dr. Singh claims.What is MSP? The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers. Irrespective of the price being offered in the market, the farmer is assured before the sowing season that they will receive at least this minimum amount for the crops they grow. It provides a safety net to farmers, which can be useful due to the volatility of prices in the agricultural market. By claiming that under the UPA government the MSP growth rate was higher, Dr. Singh is implying that the policies of the past UPA government were more favorable to farmers than that of the current NDA government. But does data support this?UPA II Vs NDA – Who did better?  There is no single value of MSP for a year, as it is announced for each particular crop. Data about different MSPs announced for each of the 25 crops from 2008 to 2018 was collated from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture’s website. The percentage increase from one year to the next for each crop was calculated for every year under the current NDA and UPA II governments. The average growth for each crop under the two periods was then found by averaging the values for the years 2009-2014 and 2014-2018. Similar data was also collated from the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) website. The data is given in the table below.Average MSP Growth Rate  CropUPA IINDAPaddy (Common)8.094.30Paddy (Grade A)8.934.27Jowar (Hybrid)13.843.18Jowar (Maldandi)13.553.22Bajra8.483.36Maize9.502.14Ragi11.436.12Arhar17.736.15Moong12.755.52Urad11.975.90Cotton (Medium Staple)8.672.10Cotton (Long Staple)6.151.95Groundnut in Shell14.411.53Sunflower Seed11.481.97Soya Bean (Black)13.713.36Soya Bean (Yellow)13.562.75Sesamum10.663.71Nigerseed8.193.09Wheat5.365.52Barley10.446.41Gram12.979.24Masur (Lentil)10.018.97Mustard11.586.37Safflower13.407.52Toria12.605.97Copra (Milling)7.785.54Copra (Ball)7.335.44Dehusked Coconut7.985.48Jute13.3611.19Sugarcane22.425.04 What about UPA I Vs UPA II Vs NDA? Similar calculations were done using the RBI data for seven food crops. Using this data, we also see the growth during the UPA I rule, which Dr. Singh did not mention. We find that even during the UPA I rule, the MSP growth was mostly greater than that during the current NDA rule. In the case of gram, although UPA II has a higher average growth rate, UPA I does not. In the case of five(5) crops, UPA I has higher average growth rates than UPA II as well.Claim: Under the UPA II, the average annual MSP growth rate was 19.3%, under the NDA government; this has fallen to 3.6%Fact: From the above graph and corresponding table, we can see that under the UPA II government, the average growth for each crop (except wheat) was higher than during the current NDA government. The aggregate average growth of the MSP (all crops) during the UPA II rule was 11.28%, while that under the NDA government has been 4.91%.  These numbers were calculated by taking the average of average growth rates of all the crops during these periods. This results in a difference of 6.48 percentage points as opposed to what was claimed by Dr. Singh of 15.7 percentage points. Only in the case of Sugarcane was the difference between growth of MSP in two governments 15 percentage points.Although the magnitude of the difference is less than what is claimed, there is still a significant difference in the growth of MSP during the UPA and NDA governments. Hence the claim is PARTLY TRUE   Share The FactsDr. Manmohan SinghFormer Prime Minister of India    Under the UPA II, the average annual MSP growth rate was 19.3%, under the NDA government; this has fallen to 3.6% INDIA – Monday, May 7, 2018ShareRead More  Embed Information on embedding in your site oEmbed Linkhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3024bcbc-a87b-42c4-b58b-6b25c26b8c5eThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

      "The government claimed that Swiss Bank deposits by Indians decreased during the current government while they increased during the UPA regime. Here is a Fact Check.   In June this year, media reported that the deposits by Indians in Swiss Banks have increased by over 50% in 2017. This was apparently based on the official annual data released by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). But on 24 July 2018, the Swiss embassy released a press statement stating the following.“The figures published by the SNB are regularly mentioned in the public domain as a reliable indicator of the amount of assets held with Swiss financial institutions in respect of Indian residents. More often than not, the reports have not taken account of the way the figures have to be interpreted, which has resulted in misleading analyses. Moreover, it is frequently assumed that any assets held by Indian residents in Switzerland are undeclared (so-called ‘Black Money’).However, the cited figures that show an increase of 50% in Swiss banks’ total liabilities towards India also include non-deposit liabilities as well as business of Swiss branches located in India.To analyze Indian residents’ deposits held in Switzerland, another data source should be used. This is the so-called “locational banking statistics”, which the SNB collects in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This data source shows that the liabilities in the form of loans and deposits of Swiss-domiciled banks towards Indian non-banks decreased by 44% between 2016 and 2017.”In other words, the Swiss embassy made it clear that the figures released by the SNB may not be right ones to understand deposits of Indian residents in Swiss financial institutions. It states that the ‘locational banking statistics’, collected in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) should be used to analyse deposits of Indians in Swiss banks.What are Locational Banking Statistics? The ‘locational banking statistics’ are released quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS is owned by 60 central banks representing countries around the world. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), SNB and other major central banks are members of BIS.As per the methodology available on the BIS website, ‘the locational banking statistics (LBS) were designed to provide comprehensive and consistent quarterly data on international banking business conducted in the countries and other financial centres making up the LBS reporting area. The basic organising principle underlying the reporting requirements is the residence of the reporting banking office’. In other words, the statistics are released on the principle of the location of the reporting bank and the location of the counterpart. In India’s case, the reporting country is Switzerland and the counterpart is India.What is the government claiming? In response to a question by Congress’s Anand Sharma in the Rajya Sabha, the government referred to the press release of the Swiss embassy and claimed that ‘the loans and deposits of Indians, other than Banks, in the Swiss banks decreased by 34.5% in the year 2017 as compared to 2016. Further, there has been significant reduction in Swiss non-bank loans and deposits of Indians by 80.2% between 2013 and 2017.’ The BJP also tweeted with an infographic on the same issue that claimed such a decrease in the deposits of Indians.Have deposits by Indians in Swiss banks decreased? Going by the data on ‘locational banking statistics’ as referred to by the Swiss embassy, the liabilities in the form of loans and deposits of Swiss-domiciled banks towards Indian non-banks have been decreasing for a while now. The liabilities in the form of loans and deposits are usually used as a proxy for deposits by residents of various countries in the Swiss financial institutions.The data from the BIS is available from the year 1996. Going by this data, the liabilities of Swiss banks towards Indian non-banks had reached a peak of USD 8885 million in the year 2007, just before the global financial crisis. But following the global financial crisis, these liabilities had continuously decreased ever since except in the year 2013 when they increased marginally. It is true that between 2014 & 2017, the liabilities have decreased by more than 75%. But this is only half the picture. The infographic uploaded by the BJP conveniently uses only 2012 & 2013 as the comparison. If one were to go by the respective periods of rule by the various governments, between 2009 & 2013 (during UPA 2), the liabilities decreased by more than 50%. In fact, from a peak of USD 8885 million in 2007, the liabilities decreased by over 70% in the year 2013.Fact Check: It is true that between 2014 & 2017, when the BJP is in power, the liabilities have decreased by more than 75%. But this is only half the picture. The infographic uploaded by the BJP conveniently uses only 2012 & 2013 as the comparison. If one were to go by the respective periods of rule by the various governments, between 2009 & 2013 (during UPA 2), the liabilities decreased by more than 50%. In fact, from a peak of USD 8885 million in 2007, the liabilities decreased by over 70% in the year 2013. Hence the claim is only PARTLY TRUE since the liabilities also decreased during the UPA regime.Are these liabilities ‘Black Money’? Automatic exchange of information (AEOI) in tax matters between Switzerland & India has come into force from 1 January 2018. The Indian authorities will receive detailed information of all Indian residents that maintain an account in Swiss financial institutions starting September 2019. It cannot be concluded if all of this is black or unaccounted money. The legal foundations for introducing the AEOI came into force on 1 January 2017 in Switzerland. To date, Switzerland has activated AEOI with 38 different countries including India.What about other Countries? If one looks at the data on liabilities for other countries, it follows a similar decreasing trend though not on the same scale as India. Between 2014 & 2017, the liabilities towards non-banks in Brazil decreased by 43% and towards non-banks in Pakistan decreased by 42%. The decreasing trend is seen in most of the countries following the global financial crisis in 2008. In the case of Russia, where the liabilities increased even after 2008 to reach a peak in 2012, a 29% decrease was observed between 2014 & 2017. The decrease in India’s case doesn’t seem to be isolated. \n",
